I am an undergraduate student at [Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (IAIR)](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/#), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.xjtu.edu.cn/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. 

I am now a research intern at the [Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies (CFCS)](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/) at the [School of Computer Science](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), China, advised by Prof. [Hao Dong](https://zsdonghao.github.io/) and Dr. [Jiyao Zhang](https://jiyao06.github.io). 

Currently, my research interests are Robotic Manipulation and Vision-Language-Action Models (VLA). I also have experience exploring robotic imitation learning and reinforcement learning previously.
